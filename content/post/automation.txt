Yesterday and today I've been working on a small bash scrip to automate adding new posts, it's working pretty well so far I should be able to finish it off today. Just about 20ish lines of bash, nothing fancy.

It's clunky and a little more DIY than what I've worked on lately, but I think that's a good thing, as I'm learning a lot.
